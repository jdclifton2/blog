*Research Interests*:  Ramsey Theory, Hypergraphs, Extremal Combinatorics
Research Publications (* indicates paper is under review for publication):
 
+ *Weakend Weak Schur Numbers* *  
  + A generalization of Schur numbers, analogous to the weakened generalization of Ramsey numbers.
+ [*Monochromatic Subhypergraphs in Stochastic Processes on Hypergraphs*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00035.pdf) *  
  + A recursive formula for the number of ways to color j vertices blue in an r-uniform hyperpath of size n while avoiding a blue monochromatic sub-hyperpath of length k. 
+ *Hypergraph Ramsey Numbers Involving Trees, Stars, and Complete Hypergraphs* *  
  + Focused on further developing Ramsey theory for trees, stars, and complete hypergraphs.
