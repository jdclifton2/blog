Hello!

First, let me begin by thanking for you reading my blog. I am JC. I come from the beautiful mountains of North Carolina (pictured below).

I enjoy learning and I like to grow a wide variety of plants in the garden of my mind. Some topics I enjoy are programming, mathematics, the German language (Ich spreche ein bisschen Deutsch :] ), and basketball (go hornets :\[ ). For the past few years I have worked as a math/computer science tutor where I get to help students grow in their appreciation and knowledge for these subjects. I have also worked as a math researcher on multiple projects involving hypergraphs, graph theory, and Ramsey theory. Through my research, I have had the great honor of presenting some of my work at both the Joint Mathematics Meeting in Denver, Colorado and at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro.
